How to push images to Docker Hub using GitHub Actions


When I went over to docker hub and looked at my repository, it had clues (instructions) for pushing images.

these instructions were available on my repository page of docker hub

docker tag local-image:tagname cjmarek/my-first-repo:tagname
docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:tagname


With these clues, from a terminal, I was able to manually push an image to a repository out onto dockerHub. (I have a repository on dockerHub named: cjmarek/my-first-repo)
When my Docker desktop is started, it will log me into DockerHub, so this command worked from the terminal. dockerHub is already hooked up to GitHub somehow

In my project, CHECKPOINTVERSION2

1) I got on a terminal and changed to directory C:\UdemyReactCourse3\CheckpointVersion2\client>

2) Then I created an image from my Dockerfile.dev file and tagged that image as cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client  (see TaggingAnImage.png)

  docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client -f Dockerfile.dev .

3) Then I pushed the image to Docker hub with this . . .

  docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client
