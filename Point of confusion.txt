****** Point of confusion ********
During the various lectures, I have seen him perform 

docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .

And then at completion, he says we have a container id???? WTF
I thought we were getting an image id as a result of docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .

I thought that after running docker build -f Dockerfile.dev ., you get an image Id and then next you create a container from that image

docker run -p 8080:8081 [image id]

But Grider on more than one occasion says we have a container id that came out of the build!  WTF

see the video Section 9: "Dockerizing" Multiple Services at 4:52

I notice that my dockerfile.dev has six steps, but for some reason, the sixth step does not appear in the terminal logs for me.
I only see 5 steps. Grider shows 6 steps when he executes. He must be getting a running container, but I am not.

FROM node:lts-alpine
WORKDIR '/app'
COPY ./package.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]  <--- I think Grider gets his step to happen automatically????

In my case, I must use docker run, and doing that will kick off the container from the image.

I have a image Id after execution cdb32aa400cf25ae047b9b35a5ff147156363c78cfe13c2a03c127f11b93712b


docker run cdb32aa400cf25ae047b9b35a5ff147156363c78cfe13c2a03c127f11b93712b

And now I have a container 

At 5:56 He literally says, now lets try starting this up by running docker run with the 'container id'

HE MUST BE MISTAKENLY CALLING THE IMAGE ID THE CONTAINER ID since the instruction he is using is

 docker run [image id]

That is exactly what he is saying. Wow, so confusing!!!!!

at 122 Dockerizing Generic Node Apps video  2:42 he says it correctly
