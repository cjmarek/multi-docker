If you want to see console.log output from Non web site containers they only show up at the terminal. They do not show up in the Chrome Dev tools console.


To search for any console.logs, I must cut and paste the logs that cascade at the terminal, into a notepad document, and then search
for whatever I am looking for that way.


However, for websites such as React webSites, the console.log output from a web site will only show up in the Chrome Dev tools console.
