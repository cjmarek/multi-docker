I wrote out code for Complex by following the lecture. So that is what you are looking at with folder 06_Complex_Section_8. As it turns out 06_Complex_Section_8 won't build fully and i don't know why.
Checkpoint206 (this one) works perfectly. Checkpoint206 has all my personal comments in it. When I have time, I want to compare, line by line between the two and find out why it doesn't work.
Also, Checkpoint206 is what I have checked into GitHub. 06_Complex_Section_8 is not in GitHub
It requires being checked in to GitHub in order for the GitHub Actions to work.

But, since I don't know if I made any mistakes along the way, I have also used the Checkpoint206 zip file to produce the same code that I wrote manually. Hopefully, Checkpoint206 is complete and correct for use.

I circled back to 06_Complex_Section_8, and fixed the typos. 12/27/2025
