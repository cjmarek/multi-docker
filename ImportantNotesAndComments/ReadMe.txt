I wrote out code for Complex by following the lecture. So that is what you are looking at with folder 06_complex. As it turns out 06_complex won't build fully and i don't know why.
Checkpoint206 works perfectly. Checkpoint206 has all my personal comments in it. When I have time, I want to compare, line by line between the two and find out why it doesn't work.

But, since I don't know if I made any mistakes along the way, I have also used the Checkpoint206 zip file to produce the same code that I wrote manually. Hopefully, Checkpoint206 is complete and correct for use.
