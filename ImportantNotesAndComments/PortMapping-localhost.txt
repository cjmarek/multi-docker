I just found out that whenever you say localhost:3000, the 3000 mentioned here is in fact the port of the 'thing' that you are running, 
such as a React application. Until now, I was unsure if the 3000 was just the so called outside port, that was paired up with the default 
port 3000 that React has. 
As it turns out, localhost can also be written as 172.0.0.1, and you can do 172.0.0.1:3000. So 172.0.0.1 is the outside port. (also known as a I.P address).

This discovery came from lecture Section 13: Maintaining Sets of containers with Deployments, 198 Why use services video at 3:29

An even bigger clue is what you see when you start up a React application

When ever I start up my development server for my photography React web site, I type 'npm run start'

And I get the following output at the terminal. . . 

You can now view photography in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
  On Your Network:  http://10.6.19.43:3000   <--------------------  dumb ass
