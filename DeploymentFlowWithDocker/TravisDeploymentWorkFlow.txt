The idea for deploying with Travis and Docker.

This flow is similar to how GitHub Actions will work. So that is why I have bothered to describe the Travis flow at all.




Use Travis to run unit tests, and if the unit tests pass, merge feature branch with master.

Use Travis to deploy the images to AWS


Travis.yml is going to instruct Travis how to handle our build when we push our code up to GitHub.

Now that we have production versions (Dockerfile(s)) of all our sub projects (client, nginx, server, worker) put together

1) Create a new Git repository from inside of Complex directory. I am using CHECKPOINT206 as my directory for my git repository
2) Create a new GitHub repository out on GitHub.com
3) Link it all up to Travis CI by creating a link between GitHub and Travis CI.org. Enable the GitHub repository for Travis to attempt
to build the code that resides in GitHub. On the Travis MyAccount page, the GitHub repo will show up and you need to click the button to 
enable the GitHub repository as a build project on Travis. 
Travis will use the .travis.yml file to run the GitHub repo as a build to create the images.
4) To kick off the process, you just need to do a commit of your repo up to GitHub. Then Travis will run the project and attempt to
build the images.
5) Travis will push the images to Docker hub
6) Travis will invoke the AWS side for deployment of the Docker Images to production by sending Dockerrun.aws.json back to amazon elastic beanstalk.

The Section 11:Multi-Container Deployments to AWS is insane to watch and expect to retain any understanding of. And since I don't have a
subscription to AWS, whats the point of trying. Seems to me that there should be a AWS specialist on  the team that can do this stuff.


NOTE: I am not a paying subscriber to Travis CI. I chose to use GitHub actions instead.



When you do the commit, you need to go over to Travis CI and you will see the build process start up and then push the images to Docker hub.


The entire process of hooking up Travis CI, of running our tests, of deploying with elastic beanstalk, Docker was not required for any of that.
He says we could have done all this by using shell scripts and completely ignored Docker. He says we used Docker because it made setting up all this stuff easier.
