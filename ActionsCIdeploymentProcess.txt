Anytime that we make a change to our GitHub Repository: 

git push origin master

gitHub Actions is going to automatically use the deploy.yaml file in my project root, (.GitHub\workflows)
to pull down our gitHub repo, 

and build out a new set of production images (there will be a production Dockerfile in each of the project folders ( ./client, ./nginx, ./server, ./worker)


      - run: docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client ./client
      - run: docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-nginx ./nginx
      - run: docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-server ./server
      - run: docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-worker ./worker

When you visit the  GitHub Actions page on GitHub, you will see the build process in progress.

Any failures to build will result is a huge diagnostic log file at the GitHub Actions page.
Otherwise, for a successful process, just a green check mark will be on the GitHub Actions page.



and push them off to DockerHub.

      - run: docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client
      - run: docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-nginx
      - run: docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-server
      - run: docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-worker
