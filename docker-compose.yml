# yml file is used to invoke more than one container from a central configuration
# This yml file is a way to automate the mundane chore of entering Docker commands, arguments, port settings from a terminal, by doing them here.
# indentation is critically important or it will fail.
# doing this from one yml file puts all these containers on the same network automatically
# version is required. need to mention the version of docker compose
# He mentions that redis is a database, and postgres is a database
# Notice how we do not have a Dockerfile for 'postgres:latest' or 'redis:latest'. We are taking them directly from Docker hub.
