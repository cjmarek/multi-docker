these instructions were available of my repository page of docker hub

docker tag local-image:tagname cjmarek/my-first-repo:tagname
docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:tagname





I was able to push an image to a repository out onto dockerHub. I have a repository on dockerHub named: cjmarek/my-first-repo

In my project, CHECKPOINTVERSION2

I got on a terminal and changed to directory C:\UdemyReactCourse3\CheckpointVersion2\client>

Then I created an image from my Dockerfile.dev file and tagged that image as cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client  (see TaggingAnImage.png)

  docker build -t cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client -f Dockerfile.dev .

Then I pushed the image with this . . .

  docker push cjmarek/my-first-repo:multi-client 

It seems that I am already logged into dockerHub, so this command worked from the terminal. dockerHub is already hooked up to GitHub somehow
